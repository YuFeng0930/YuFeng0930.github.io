									<p> Backend Engineer Intern (Jul 2021 - Present)<br/> Data Engineer Intern (May 2021 - Jul 2021)</p>
                                    <p>
                                        Shopee was founded in Singapore in 2015 and has since
                                        grown to become a prominent e-commerce platform in Southeast Asia 
                                        and Taiwan, offering customers a simple, secure, and convenient online shopping experience.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        During my first 12 weeks of full-time internship as a Data Engineer Intern, I was primarily responsible for developing Spark data pipelines on distributed systems, 
                                        and I programmed in Scala on Hadoop framework (HDFS, Spark, Yarn) and scheduled using Airflow. Beginning with the entry assignment, I am now capable of designing and completing a data 
                                        pipeline project on my own.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After working full-time for Shopee for 12 weeks and gaining a comprehensive view of the data engineering area, I'd want to try something new and steepen my learning curve once again. 
                                        As a result, I sought a transfer to work part-time as a Backend Engineer Intern during the semester. I'm still on my backend journey to develop some APIs using Golang. 
                                        I'll write more about it here as I get more experience.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This has been a fruitful internship so far that allows me to get exposure to an area rarely explicitly taught in school. 
                                        This experience would provide me with a clearer picture while making decisions about my future career path and, most importantly, 
                                        being more adaptable and resilient to the challenges I may encounter in the future.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I would want to thank my mentor, Minh, who is always encouraging and helpful when I have questions. 
                                        You are so knowledgeable that there hasn't been a single occasion when I asked you a question and 
                                        you didn't know how to solve it. You could also accurately assess my abilities and assign me tasks 
                                        hat will allow me to get the most out of this internship.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        I would want to thank Peng Yang, the leader of my team. Even if our team has nearly twenty members 
                                        and I am only an intern, you would still care about my progress and whether I learned the knowledge or not. 
                                        I will always remember what you said about focusing on "absorbing and completely understanding the knowledge" 
                                        rather than merely "getting things done."
                                    </br></br>
                                    </p>
